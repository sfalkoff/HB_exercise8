Would you, could you in a house
Would you, could you with a mouse
Would you, could you in a box
Would you, could you with a fox
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I Am?

Not in a box. 
Not with a fox. 
Not in a house. 
Not with a mouse. 
I would not eat them here or there. 
I would not eat them anywhere. 
I would not eat green eggs and ham. 
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
